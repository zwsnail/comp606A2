Hi Reveena, 


I changed the database, created a new account"comp606A2" password "123" instead of rooter.
Today I changed a little bit more. 
the database, created a new account"comp606A2" password "123" instead of rooter.
add delete function for trademan.
Try my best made some style (ðŸ˜¬)


//still need to improve:
1. sitedown page
2. style for displaying all the tables(maybe use jQuery style to show the tables?)
   also maybe something like estimate ID no need to show there, how do you think?
3. register new user by using already same name&password(duplication), it's allowed so far....if too much do fix it, just ignore it...
4.
2. style for displaying all the tables(maybe use jQuery style to show the tables?) will be more organised.
3. still can register new user by using already same name&password(duplication), it's allowed so far....if too much do fix it, just ignore it...
4. I tried a lot to do this but failed:
   if a trademan bid a job...
   then he couldn't bid the same job,,,,the bid button will be disable....
   if you have some idea?
   if too complicated, don't worry.

  so far we are good, I think ðŸ˜¸
